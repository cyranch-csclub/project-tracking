# Member page on Club Website

## Proposer
Shubh R. (acemavrick)


## Goal
To create a page/section on the club's website that would list all the members of this GitHub organization.

## Proposed Tech Stack
- Language(s): TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, CSS\*

> \*Using non-vanilla CSS frameworks (like TailwindCSS) is fine

## Prerequisites/Skills Needed
Basic web dev. Shouldn't be too hard.

## Details
This project may be as simple as making a page that queries GitHub's extensive REST API, 
specifically the [endpoint to list organization members](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/members?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-organization-members). 
Further research into how this is done is be required. 

Most of the work will probably be in formatting the queried data in a clean format.

## Open Questions
A more detailed plan of action needs to be made.
